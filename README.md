# **Python-Challenge**
The Python-Challenge repository is made up of two real-world situations requiring the use of Python to analyze large data sets in order to efficiently draw conlcusions. The **Company Financial Analysis** and the **Voting Poll Outcome** use iterative loops, conditional statements, lists and dictionaries as the primary componenets of the respective scripts. 

## **Company Financial Analysis**

### Overview


### File Structure

The **Company Financial Analysis** is storedd within the **PyBank** folder. 

The **PyBank** folder has the following sstructure:

PyBank:
- Analysis
    - budget_analysis_output.txt
- Resources
    - budget_data.csv
- main.py

### Running the Script

1. Verify that the folder and file structure being used on your local directory matches that of the outlined file structure, **excluding** the **budget_analysis_output.txt** file. The output file will be automatically generated by the script if a file within the **Alanysys** folder does not already exist.

2. Open local machine Terminal/GitBash

3. Navigate to the appropriate **PyBank** directory where all of the **Company Financial Analysis** folders and files are stored. 

4. Input the **python main.py** command and execute.

### Output

The Python script analyzes the monthly financial records to calculate each of the following:

  - The total number of months included in the dataset (**Total Months**)

  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period (**Total**)

  - CThe average month over month change in "Profit/Losses" (**Average Change**)

  - The greatest month over month increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period (**Greates Increase in Profits**)

  - The greatest decrease in month over month losses (date and amount) over the entire period (**Greates Decrease in Profits**)

The results are then printed to ther Terminal and saved in the **Analysis** folder as the text file **budget_analysis_output.txt**

### Results

Based on the Python script, the results of the analysis are as follows: 

Financial Analysis
----------------------------------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578.0
Average Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: $1926159.0 on Feb-2012
Greatest Decrease in Profits: $-2196167.0 on Sep-2013

## **Voting Poll Outcome**

### Overview

### File Structure

The **Voting Poll Outcome** is storedd within the **PyPoll** folder. 

The **PyPoll** folder has the following sstructure:

PyPoll:
- Analysis
    - election_analysis_output.txt
- Resources
    - election_data.csv
- main.py
